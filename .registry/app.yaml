overview: |
  Wordpress is a relatively simple sample application that only
  requires compute to run its containerized binary and a MySQL
  database. The Wordpress application can be deployed on top of
  the Crossplane Sample Stacks for GCP, AWS, and Azure -- or any
  stack that provides the neccesary service catalog.
readme: |
  Applications allow you to define your application and its
  managed service dependencies as a single installable unit.
  Applications are portable in that they create claims for
  infrastructure that are satisfied by different managed
  service implementations depending on what stacks are
  installed in your environment.

  The Wordpress application can be deployed on top of stacks
  that provide the default resource classes capable of
  satisfying the required infrastructure claims for things
  like a MySQL database and a Kubernetes Cluster. All of
  the following stacks provide the neccesary default
  resource classes in their service catalog:
  `GCP Sample Stack`, `AWS Sample Stack`, and
  `Azure Sample Stack`.

  You can even make your own stacks and the Wordpress
  application will deploy successfully on top as long
  as the stack provides the neccesary default resource
  classes. Checkout the [Crossplane docs]
  (https://crossplane.github.io/docs) for more info.
