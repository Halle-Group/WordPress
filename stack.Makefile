# Sooo ideally this wouldn't be a single line, but the idea here is that when we're
# developing locally, we want to use our locally-published container image for the
# Stack's controller container. The container image is specified in the install
# yaml for the Stack. This means we need two versions of the install:
#
# * One for "regular", production publishing
# * One for development
#
# The way this has been implemented here is by having the base install yaml be the
# production install, with a yaml patch on the side for use during development.
# *This* make recipe creates the development install yaml, which requires doing
# some patching of the original install and putting it back in the stack package
# directory. It's done here as a post-processing step after the stack package
# has been generated, which is why the output to a copy and then rename step is
# needed. This is not the only way to implement this functionality.
#
# The implementation here is general, in the sense that any other yamls in the
# overrides directory will be patched into their corresponding files in the
# stack package. It assumes that all of the yamls are only one level deep.
